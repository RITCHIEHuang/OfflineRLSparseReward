\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prel}
{\bf Notations:} $[p] = \{1,2,\cdots, p\}$. $d$ is the dimension of decision space, and $e_i$ represents $i$-th basis vector. For a vector $x$ and a matrix $M$, define $\norm{x}_M:=\sqrt{x^\top Mx}$. Given a set $\mc{W}$, we define the projection into this set as $\Pi_{\mc{W}}(\cdot)$.
